I have completed both the Encryption alogrithm & Key shcrdular 
using the round blocks that Hassan provided us. 

Then, integrated them both under one TOP level: 'AES_ENC_TOP.v' 
also have tested the whole design using a Key & PT and 
check CT_i and Final CT through the excel sheet 

and got successful results.

This desing is not the final desing for iterative encryption, 
soon ISA I will ptimize the RTL: 
- Adding FSM in separate file to solve the current complexity in
  'AES_Encryption.v' 
- make it suitable for a better no. of sequential stages per round, 
  we will ask Dr.Hatem about that.
