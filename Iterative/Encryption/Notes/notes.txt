* firstTo9th_rounds: 
- I need a counter to inform me that I am @ 9th round 
-- to turn off the mid_round iterative block and ON the last round 


* metrics: 
- area will be 1/10. 
- but can't pipeline it so latency = 10 clock cycles to 
  get one CT out. 

 
* for round counter: 
- for selector of PT input (count != 1), I think I need to stop the 
  counter (?) 
-- count !=1 instead of making a comparator. 

C0 = B0*02 xor B1*03 xor B2*01 + B3

* for this iterative design, I need also a VALID signal !
